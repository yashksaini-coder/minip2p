//! Application-facing `Endpoint` API for minip2p.
//!
//! This crate is the ergonomic std entrypoint. It composes the lower-level
//! crates without hiding them: protocol crates and `SwarmCore` remain the
//! Sans-I/O / `no_std + alloc` surface, while [`Endpoint`] gives applications a
//! small batteries-included API for identity, transports, listen/dial, ping,
//! and event polling.
//!
//! # Transports
//!
//! Prefer address-shaped listening: pass complete multiaddresses to
//! [`EndpointBuilder::listen_on`] (or [`EndpointBuilder::listen_default`] for
//! dual-stack QUIC) and call [`EndpointBuilder::bind`]. The builder infers
//! QUIC vs TCP from each address and groups compatible IPv4/IPv6 listeners
//! onto one transport per shape.
//!
//! Dial routing is address-shaped too: a `/udp/…/quic-v1` candidate is
//! reached over QUIC and a `/tcp` one over TCP.
//!
//! With the `pubsub` feature, `EndpointBuilder::gossipsub` enables gossipsub
//! and `EndpointBuilder::gossipsub_config` tunes it with a `GossipsubConfig`.
//!
//! The `nat` feature exposes relay, AutoNAT, and DCUtR coordination. The
//! `discovery` feature includes `nat` and `pubsub`, adding signed presence
//! beacons plus a bounded peer book. The `mdns` feature includes `nat` but not
//! `pubsub`, and adds caller-driven local-link multicast discovery. Enable
//! both discovery sources to feed one shared peer book and automatic-dial
//! state. Cargo features expose these APIs; the corresponding builder methods
//! activate their drivers.
//!
//! The independent std-only `relay-server` feature enables the three-line
//! `Endpoint::builder().relay_server().listen_on(…)?.bind()` hosting path. Relay-only
//! endpoints advertise inbound HOP and open outbound STOP; NAT-only endpoints
//! install the trusted client roles, and combined endpoints compose both.
